h1. Microformats Outline

Agenda

* What is the Semantic Web? What's Web 3.0?
* What are Microformats? Why do Microformats matter?
* Microformats and Browser Plugins and JavaScript APIs
* Microformats and Ruby on Rails
* Adding semantics to your web pages (marking up people, events, locations and more using Microformats) and 
  enabling Google Map listings, exporting contacts to your address book and more.
* Creating RESTful web services using Microformats


h1. What is the Semantic Web? What's Web 3.0?

What's HTML?

* The world's most popular markup language.
* About 50 tags to markup hypertext documents.

Less than 50 tags -> lots of meaning (that is, semantics) gets lost when marking up documents.

Example:

{{{
<h1>VanDev: Microformats - Adding Semantics to Your Web Site</h1>

<p>Wednesday, April 16, 2008  <br>

UBC Robson Square<br>
800 Robson St.<br>
Vancouver, British Columbia<br>
</p>
}}}

HTML tags such as @h1@ (heading1) and @p@ (paragraph) and @br@ (break) are kind of meaningless (without semantics).
